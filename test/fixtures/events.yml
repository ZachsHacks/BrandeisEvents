  name: "Physics Department Colloquium: How to control the size of a self-assembling, self-filling shell"
  description: "Speaker: Michael Hagan (Brandeis)\n\nAbstract: The self-assembly of a protein shell around a cargo is a common mechanism of encapsulation in biology. For example, many viruses assemble an icosahedral protein shell (capsid) around the the viral nucleic acid. Some viruses then acquire an additional exterior coating by budding through a cell membrane. Similarly, bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are large icosahedral protein shells that assemble around collections of enzymes to act as organelles inside of bacteria.\n\nIn this talk I will use coarse-grained computational models and simple scaling calculations to illuminate the factors that control such a self-assembly process. I will particularly focus on how material properties (such as nucleic acid electric charge, membrane bending modulus, or enzyme cohesive forces) control assembly pathways and the size of the assembled shell.\n\nHost: Bulbul Chakraborty, Bjoern Penning.\n\nContact Dawn Mitchell, 781-736-2804 for more information."
